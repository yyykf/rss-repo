When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don't use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a \"pseudo\" summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.\nThank you: @LooperXX.",

          "description": "一、背景介绍\n1.1 API网关是什么？\nAPI网关是随着微服务（Microservice）概念兴起的一种架构模式。原本一个庞大的单体应用（All in one）业务系统被拆分成许多微服务（Microservice）系统进行独立的维护和部署，服务拆分带来的变化是API的规模成倍增长，API的管理难度也在日益增加，使用API网关发布和管理API逐渐成为一种趋势。一般来说，API网关是运行于外部请求与内部服务之间的一个流量入口，实现对外部请求的协议转换、鉴权、流控、参数校验、监控等通用功能。\n1.2 为什么要做Shepherd API网关？\n在没有Shepherd API网关之前，美团业务研发人员如果要将内部服务输出为对外的HTTP API接口。通常要搭建一个Web应用，用于完成基础的鉴权、限流、监控日志、参数校验、协议转换等工作，同时需要维护代码逻辑、基础组件的升级，研发效率相对比较低。此外，每个Web应用都需要维护机器、配置、数据库等，资源利用率也非常差。\n美团内部一些业务线苦于没有现成的解决方案，根据自身业务特点，研发了业务相关的API网关。放眼业界，亚马逊、阿里巴巴、腾讯等公司也都有成熟的API网关解决方案。\n因此，Shepherd API网关项目正式立项，我们的目标是为美团提供高性能、高可用、可扩展的统一API网关解决方案，让业务研发人员通过配置的方式即可对外开放功能和数据。\n\n1.3 使用Shepherd带来的收益是什么？\n从业务研发人员的角度来看，接入Shepherd API网关，能带来哪些收益呢？简而言之包括三个方面。\n\n提升研发效率\n业务研发人员只需要通过配置的方式即可快速开放服务接口。\nShepherd统一提供鉴权、限流、熔断等非业务基础能力。\nShepherd支持业务研发人员通过开发自定义组件的方式扩展API网关能力。\n\n降低沟通成本\n业务研发人员配置好A…",

          "description": "1 BFF的由来\nBFF一词来自Sam Newman的一篇博文《Pattern:Backends For Frontends》，指的是服务于前端的后端。BFF是解决什么问题的呢？据原文描述，随着移动互联网的兴起，原适应于桌面Web的服务端功能希望同时提供给移动App使用，而在这个过程中存在这样的问题：\n\n移动App和桌面Web在UI部分存在差异。\n移动App涉及不同的端，不仅有iOS、还有Android，这些不同端的UI之间存在差异。\n原有后端功能和桌面Web UI之间已经存在了较大的耦合。\n\n因为端的差异性存在，服务端的功能要针对端的差异进行适配和裁剪，而服务端的业务功能本身是相对单一的，这就产生了一个矛盾——服务端的单一业务功能和端的差异性诉求之间的矛盾。那么这个问题怎么解决呢？这也是文章的副标题所描述的”Single-purpose Edge Services for UIs and external parties”，引入BFF，由BFF来针对多端差异做适配，这也是目前业界广泛使用的一种模式。\n\n在实际业务的实践中，导致这种端差异性的原因有很多，有技术的原因，也有业务的原因。比如，用户的客户端是Android还是iOS，是大屏还是小屏，是什么版本。再比如，业务属于哪个行业，产品形态是什么，功能投放在什么场景，面向的用户群体是谁等等。这些因素都会带来面向端的功能逻辑的差异性。\n在这个问题上，笔者所在团队负责的商品展示业务有一定的发言权，同样的商品业务，在C端的展示功能逻辑，深刻受到商品类型、所在行业、交易形态、投放场所、面向群体等因素的影响。同时，面向消费者端的功能频繁迭代的属性，更是加剧并深化了这种矛盾，使其演化成了一种服务端单一稳定与端的差异灵活之间的矛盾，这也是商品展示（商品展示BFF）业务系统存在的必然性原因。本文主要在美团到店商品展示场景的背景下，介绍面临的…",
